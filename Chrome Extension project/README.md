## ℹ️ About this project

This project that is a part of [Scrimba's Learn JavaScript Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) by Per Harald Borgen.

This is part of a module, where we have to build a project while learning JavaScript concepts.

In this project I had to create a Unit Converter to convert Length, Volume and Mass from the value inserted on the input.

The main goal of the project was to practise and learn the concepts `.addEventListener()`, `.push()`, `for loops`, `.innerHTML`, `.createElement()`, `.append()` and `localStorage`.
